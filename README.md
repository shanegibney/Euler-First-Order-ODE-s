# Euler Method for 1st order ODE's

[gh-pages](https://shanegibney.github.io/Euler-First-Order-ODE-s/)

This code will solve the simplest first order, ordinary differential equations using the Euler method.

Note: derivates must be input using \* as a multiplication operator between variables, i.e. x\*y

However * is not necessary for multiplication by a constant i.e. 2x.

This is due to the way math.js handles functions.
