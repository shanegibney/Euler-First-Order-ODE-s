# Euler Method for 1st order ODE's

[gh-pages](https://shanegibney.github.io/Euler-First-Order-ODE-s/)

Uses the vue.js 2.2.2 framework and JavaScript library math.js 3.10.0

This code will solve the simplest first order, ordinary differential equations using the Euler method.

Next: I hope to add a graph of the approximated result using D3.js
